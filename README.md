# Splash-Maker-
A tool for making SPLASH SCREEN
---------------------
How use this script ?
---------------------
1) Clone this repo
2) Extract end.zip
3) Replace the splash screen with your images (use only .bmp files)
4) Click on generate_splash.cmd
5) Copy splash.img and META-INF to a new folder and zip it. :-)
----------------------
Thats it you made your own splash :-)
----------------------
Note:
1) The META-INF i have include in this repo is for the device Redmi note 7 pro , if u use this META-INF for making Splash for other devices it will not work.
2) Give correct resolution for the device , other wise it will be blank ( for my device its 1080x2160)
3) Use 16 bit format after editing the splash.(Photoshop)
